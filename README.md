<h2>Why?</h2>
You may have seen people in the chat beg to find out how chat colors and gradients work<br>
so we wanted to fix it by making them an easy-to-use generator with advanced features.<br>

<h2>Contributors</h2>
<h3>Death</h3> - Basically did everything, from UI to scraping blook data.<br>
<h3>Acai</h3> - Gradient selector and blook color extractor.<br>
